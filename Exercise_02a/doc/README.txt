Exercise 2a: Exp1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise you will add new constructs to the Exp1 language and deal with their evaluation.

Add the following constructs to the language:
  - a power operator
  - a factorial operator
  - search for [// your code here] within Exp1.mo

The parser/lexer are ready, but give parser errors for the new operators until they are added in \code{Exp1.mo} (add them last in the uniontype to avoid weird errors).
The parser/lexer uses a prefix factorial operator (!5, not 5!).
SOLUTION.txt presents the solution to the assignment.

To run this exercise type [omc run.mos] or just execute run.bat.
If you need to edit the input of the calculator edit the file called input.txt.
